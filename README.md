# Speech-Recognition
Nothing special, just saving for myself this project that I need to change and improve for personal utilization. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just a reminder that the SpeechRecognition library requires PyAudio, which needs to be downloaded from this website if you're using Python 3.7 or higher:
https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio

for downloading the libraries:
pip install deep_translator
pip install speechrecognition
pip install futures
